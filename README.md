# PhishermanFlood
### A way to give back to the Phishers

This project is a scripting library that can be used to quickly generate a bunch of fake but realistic looking data. The purpose of this project is to provide an easy to use tool for fighting back at phishing scams. Using these functions, you can generate and send out loads of fake user data, and flood the logs of the scammers who are trying to steal your information.

By successfully using this tool to create a flood script, not only will you make the bulk data they collect much harder to use or sell, but more importantly you will feel satisfaction from knowing that you have just become an enourmous pain in the phisher's ass.
